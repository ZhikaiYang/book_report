Basic model$$y_{ij} = \mu_i + g_i + e_{ij} \hspace{150pt} (1.1)$$
q1. Is the definition of $e_{ij}$ correct? (p1)

Ignoring dominance and epistasis, the model becomes$$y_{ij} = \mu_i + g_{ai} + e_{ij}^* \hspace{150pt} (1.2)$$
q2. It is assumed that var(y), var(g)and var($e^*$) are known, but how are var(g)and var($e^*$) calculated?(p2)
q3. From Eqn 1.2, the problem of predicting breeding value reduces to that of adjusting phenotypic observations for identifiable
non-random environmental effects and appropriately weighting the records of animals and their available relatives. How is this done specifically? (p2)

Estimated breeding value(EBV) from single record:
$$\hat{a_i} = b(y_i - \mu) \hspace{150pt} (1.3)$$
$$b = cov(a, y)/var(y)=cov(a, a+e)/var(y)=\sigma_a^2/\sigma_y^2=h^2$$
q4. How can $\sigma_a^2$(variance of breeding value) be known while we still need to predict a(breedding value)? In this case, $\mu_i$ is a constant, right? if yes, how can you adjust it in q3?(p3)
$$r_{a,y} = cov(a, y)/\sigma_a\sigma_y=\sigma_a^2/\sigma_a\sigma_y=h$$
($r_{a,y}$ : accuracy of prediction, a:true breeding value, y:index to predict the true breeding value)


Estimated breeding value(EBV) from single record(p4):
q5. With repeated measurements it is assumed that there is additional resemblance between records of an individual due to environmental factors or circumstances that affect the records of the individual permanently.  
                                                  var(y)= var(g) + var(pe) + var(te)  
(var(pe) = variance due to permanent environmental effect; var(te) = variance due to random temporary environmental effect)
                                                  t = (var(g)+var(pe)/var(y))          (1.5)
